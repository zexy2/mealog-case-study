# Licensing: code, data, and provenance

The software in this repository is MIT-licensed (see [`LICENSE`](../LICENSE)).
That licence deliberately does **not** extend to third-party nutrition data,
evaluation fixtures, screenshots, or trademarks. This document records the
source, attribution, and reuse boundaries for each data pack.

Read this before reusing the repository, and again before publishing a fork.
The default state of any data pack is "not mine to sublicense"; only the US
pack is public domain.

## Turkish locale pack: TürKomp

Files covered:

- `locale_packs/tr/foods.jsonl`
- project metadata that refers to those rows in `locale_packs/tr/`

Required attribution:

> TürKomp, Ulusal Gıda Kompozisyon Veri Tabanı, versiyon 1.0,
> <https://turkomp.tarimorman.gov.tr/>

Official conditions: [TürKomp data-use conditions](https://turkomp.tarimorman.gov.tr/useofdata).

The Turkish pack is marked `restricted-noncommercial`. The official conditions
allow conditioned noncommercial information sharing and require visible source
attribution for written use plus a clickable source link for internet use.
Commercial use in software or on a website requires a separate agreement with
the authorised institution. This repository does not grant that permission.

The pack contains 57 selected rows. Nutrient values identify TürKomp as their
source. Project `food_id` values, transliterated/display labels, aliases, serving
defaults, density annotations, retrieval metadata, and confidence behavior are
mealog additions; they are not represented as official TürKomp fields. Consult
the official source rather than treating this subset as a complete or current
copy of the database.

## Japanese locale pack: unverified legacy data

Files covered:

- `locale_packs/ja_JP/foods.jsonl`
- project metadata that refers to those rows in `locale_packs/ja_JP/`

The pack originally declared [MEXT, Standard Tables of Food Composition in
Japan](https://www.mext.go.jp/a_menu/syokuhinseibun/index.htm) as its source.
Row-level review did not establish that provenance for the pack as a whole:
only 2 of 8 rows exactly matched the four checked nutrient fields in the 2015
tables, while the remaining rows did not exactly match the checked 2015, 2020,
or 2023 tables. The repository therefore does **not** present this pack as
verified MEXT data.

The pack remains marked `unverified` and is rejected in mealog commercial mode.
Its rows are retained only as legacy, non-production evaluation material until
each value has a traceable source edition and record identifier.

## US locale pack: USDA FoodData Central

Files covered:

- `locale_packs/en_US/foods.jsonl`
- project metadata that refers to those rows in `locale_packs/en_US/`

Source: [USDA FoodData Central](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/).

The pack metadata records this source as `public-domain`. Project-specific IDs,
aliases, serving defaults, and retrieval metadata remain mealog additions.

## Evaluation fixtures

`eval/fixtures/` holds recorded provider responses. They are observations made
by Mealog during evaluation; they contain food descriptions only — no photos,
no personal identifiers, and no raw provider envelopes. They are included so the
offline scorecard can be reproduced without an API key. They are evidence of
integration, not an accuracy benchmark, and are not a data set for training.

## Reuse checklist

1. Want the code only? Use it under MIT and delete `locale_packs/tr/`.
2. Want the Turkish pack? Obtain the required agreement with the authorised
   institution first — this repository's MIT licence does not provide it.
3. Want the Japanese pack? Treat it as unverified and do not ship it to users.
4. Want a new market? Add a pack with its own `pack.yaml` and `license` field;
   commercial mode refuses to load packs that are not clearly licensed.
