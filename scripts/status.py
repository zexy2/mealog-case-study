"""Generate STATUS.md by probing the repository.

A hand-written status file drifts, and a drifted status file is just a false
claim with extra steps — this repository has already shipped two of those today
(a fine-tuning doc headed "Implemented", a PR body claiming no new
dependencies). So status is derived from the working tree, not asserted, and CI
fails if the committed file disagrees with what the probes find.

Probes assert execution artifacts where the repository can prove them. Device
execution is external and stays partial until the walkthrough.

    python scripts/status.py            # regenerate STATUS.md
    python scripts/status.py --check    # fail if STATUS.md is stale
